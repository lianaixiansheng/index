#### 今天星期天我上课，我的脑海里整个弥漫了我not worthy的想法，那别人的头脑里是否也弥漫了这样呢？
#### 感觉一些正面的情绪开始在升起，玩冒险岛很开心，练了英语口语。看了letting go的wealth和hapiness这两节，
#### 1.The unconscious brings to us what it thinks we deserve.If our view of ourselves is small, limited, and miserly—due to accumulated guilt—then the unconscious will bring those economic conditions into our life.
#### 2.Without being conscious of what money means to us emotionally, we are at the effect of it.We are being run by our unconscious beliefs about money and all of its associated programs.
#### 3.we are free from that inner smallness, insecurity, and low self-esteem.
#### 结合下面所写，我们总是通过外在来填补内在的空虚，而我们的默认状态是渺小、不安、低自尊。
#### 4.When letting go, struggling actors now have starring roles in Hollywood. A playwright on the edge of poverty becomes the producer of a smash Broadway
#### 5.The inner negativity results in such commonly held beliefs as,”You” are born alone and you die alone
#### 6.Because of attachments, dependencies, and inner smallness, we may feel weak and limited.
#### 7.The ego-mind, which sees everyone as separate.
#### 8.Self-condemnation gets endlessly projected onto the world, taking the form of condemnation from other, which increases further the guilt and feeling of smallness.
#### 9.Often the insensitivity comes with self-excuse, such as:”I am an upfront person who speaks my mind” or “I am the frank type”
#### 10.The low self-esteem results in criticism of self and others, constant competition and comparison, analyzing, contempt, intellectualization, doubt, and fantasies of revenge.
#### 11.In such a state, we become progressively alienated because there is so much of ourselves that we must hide.
#### 12.the endless appointments, phone calls, errands, social engagements, home responsibilities, and emails.今天的突然醒悟原来这是我昨天看到这在心中埋下的种子
#### 13.All of this is motivated by the desire to somehow derive meaning and security, and to increase our self-esteem and ensure our self-worth by whatever means.
